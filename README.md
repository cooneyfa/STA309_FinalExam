# STA309_FinalExam
Overview
For my final exam, I chose to analyze NFL Combine data from Pro Football Reference. I built predictive models to determine whether or not a player will be drafted. The merged dataset includes height, weight, 40-yard dash, vertical jump, BMI, and a positional group variable.

Dataset Sources
Combine Data (PFR): https://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/2024-combine.htm  
Draft Results (PFR): https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2024/draft.htm


Models Used
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors
Support Vector Machine

Key findings include: Random Forest performed best (ROC ≈ 0.61), but all models struggled due to class imbalance and the limited predictive value of physical metrics alone.
